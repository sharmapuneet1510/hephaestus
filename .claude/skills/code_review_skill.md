# Code Review Skill v3 — Requirement-Driven Analysis

---

## 1. Overview

**Code Review Skill v3** provides reusable logic for requirement-driven code reviews. Instead of reviewing code in isolation, it validates that PR/MR changes actually implement what was requested in the JIRA ticket.

### Key Innovation

Combines **requirement validation** (new) + **code quality review** (existing) in a single framework with transparent scoring and grading.

### Process Phases

| Phase | Input | Output | Scoring |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. Requirement Analysis | JIRA ticket | Layman's terms summary + ACs | N/A (qualitative) |
| 2. Requirement Validation | Code diff + Requirement | Coverage %, gap list | 0-100% |
| 3. Code Quality Review | Code diff | Issues by category/severity | 0-100% per category |
| 4. Test Coverage Analysis | Code + test files | Coverage %, missing scenarios | 0-100% |
| 5. Documentation Analysis | Code diff | Doc completeness %, gaps | 0-100% |
| 6. Scorecard Calculation | All % scores | Final grade A-F | Weighted average |

---

## 2. Phase 1: Requirement Analysis

### Purpose
Parse the JIRA requirement and translate it to plain English. Identify acceptance criteria and scope boundaries.

### Input
- JIRA ticket object:
  ```json
  {
    "key": "PROJ-123",
    "summary": "User Registration with Email Validation",
    "description": "Allow new users to sign up with email and password...",
    "acceptance_criteria": [
      "User can enter email and password",
      "Email validation is enforced",
      "Passwords are hashed securely",
      "Success notification sent"
    ],
    "scope_notes": "Desktop and mobile friendly"
  }
  ```

### Process Steps

**Step 1: Extract Core Components**
- Feature summary (what is being built?)
- Feature description (why is it needed?)
- Acceptance criteria (AC1, AC2, ...)
- Scope boundaries (what's included? what's NOT?)
- Constraints (performance, security, UX)

**Step 2: Translate to Layman's Terms**
- Remove technical jargon
- Highlight "what success looks like"
- Simplify for non-technical stakeholders
- Note any assumptions or open questions

**Step 3: Identify Key Requirements**
- User-facing changes
- System behavior changes
- Data integrity requirements
- Security/compliance requirements

### Output Format

```markdown
## Requirement Analysis

### Feature
User Registration with Email Validation

### In Plain English
"Allow new users to sign up with email and password. The system should:
- Let users enter their email and password
- Validate the email format
- Hash passwords securely before storage
- Send a confirmation email after signup
- Work on mobile and desktop"

### Acceptance Criteria
- [AC1] User can enter email and password on signup form
- [AC2] Email validation enforces valid format (RFC 5322)
- [AC3] Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (or equiv) before storage
- [AC4] Success confirmation email is sent after signup
- [AC5] Form is responsive on mobile and desktop

### Scope Boundaries
- **Included**: Email/password signup, validation, hashing, email sending
- **NOT Included**: Social login, 2FA, password reset, email verification link
- **Constraints**: Email must be sent within 2 seconds; password rules enforced

### Key Assumptions
- Email service is already available (assumed from JIRA)
- Frontend validation should mirror backend validation
- No rate limiting required at this stage
```

---

## 3. Phase 2: Requirement Validation

### Purpose
Map code changes to acceptance criteria. Score how well the PR implements the requirement.

### Input
- Code diff (files added/modified)
- Requirement from Phase 1

### Process Steps

**Step 1: Map Code to Requirements**
- Which files implement which AC?
- Is each AC addressed in the code?
- Any over-engineering (unnecessary features)?

For the user registration example:
```
AC1 (email/password form)
  ✅ frontend/components/SignupForm.tsx (email, password inputs)
  ✅ backend/routes/auth.py (POST /auth/signup endpoint)

AC2 (email validation)
  ✅ backend/validators/email.py (RFC 5322 validator)
  ✅ frontend/validators/email.ts (client-side check)

AC3 (password hashing)
  ✅ backend/services/auth.py (bcrypt hashing in create_user)

AC4 (confirmation email)
  ✅ backend/services/email.py (send_confirmation_email function)
  ⚠️  No test for email sending failure

AC5 (responsive UI)
  ✅ frontend/styles/signup.css (mobile breakpoints)
  ⚠️  No explicit mobile test
```

**Step 2: Identify Gaps**
- Missing implementations
- Partial implementations
- Untested functionality
- Known workarounds

**Step 3: Calculate Coverage Score**

| Coverage Range | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| 100% | All AC fully implemented, no gaps | All AC working, tested, documented |
| 90-99% | All AC implemented, minor gaps | One AC partially tested; docs incomplete |
| 75-89% | Most AC implemented, notable gaps | One AC missing; error handling incomplete |
| 60-74% | Significant AC missing | Two ACs not implemented; basic structure only |
| <60% | Major implementation incomplete | Scope fundamentally incomplete |

### Output Format

```markdown
## Requirement Validation

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Requirement | Status | Notes |
|----|---|---|---|
| AC1 | User can enter email and password | ✅ Complete | Form UI + backend endpoint implemented |
| AC2 | Email validation enforced | ✅ Complete | RFC 5322 validator in backend + frontend |
| AC3 | Passwords hashed securely | ✅ Complete | bcrypt with salt in create_user() |
| AC4 | Confirmation email sent | ⚠️ Partial | Email service integrated, but no error handling |
| AC5 | Responsive UI (mobile + desktop) | ✅ Complete | CSS breakpoints verified |

### Coverage Assessment
- **Requirement Met: 95%**
- Fully implemented: 4/5 AC (AC1, AC2, AC3, AC5)
- Partially implemented: 1/5 AC (AC4 — missing error handling)

### Identified Gaps
1. **AC4 Gap**: Email sending has no retry logic if SMTP fails
   - Impact: Silent failure; user thinks signup worked but never receives email
   - Fix: Add exponential retry + fallback notification

2. **Testing Gap**: No test for email failure scenario
   - Impact: Deployment risk if email service goes down
   - Fix: Mock email service failures in integration tests

### Gap Severity
- P0: Missing implementation of core AC
- P1: Partial implementation (happy path works, error handling missing)
- P2: Untested functionality
- P3: Documentation missing

### Scope Creep Check
- ✅ No unnecessary features added
- ✅ All code aligns with stated ACs
- ✅ No gold-plating detected
```

## 4. Phase 3: Code Quality Review

### Purpose
Evaluate code against design, SOLID, patterns, performance, security, testing, and documentation standards.

### Input
- Code diff (full changes)
- Tech stack (detected from file extensions, imports, frameworks)

### Code Quality Categories

#### 4.1 Design & Architecture (Structure)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Single Responsibility Principle: Each class/function has one reason to change?
- [ ] Appropriate abstraction levels (not god classes, not over-fragmented)?
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns (UI ≠ business logic ≠ data access)?
- [ ] No circular dependencies or tightly coupled modules?
- [ ] Interfaces/contracts defined for key components?

**Scoring Guidance:**
- 90-100%: Clear structure, good separation, extensible
- 75-89%: Minor coupling issues, mostly clean
- 60-74%: Some god classes or tight coupling
- <60%: Structural issues impact maintainability

**Example Issues:**

```
Issue: God Class (Authentication.java)
Severity: P1 (Design issue)
Location: src/auth/Authentication.java, line 1-450
Problem: Single class handles login, logout, token refresh, password hashing, email sending
Why: Hard to test, hard to maintain, violates SRP
Fix: Split into:
  - LoginService (login logic)
  - TokenService (token refresh)
  - PasswordService (hashing)
  - EmailService (sending)
```

#### 4.2 SOLID Principles

**Checklist:**
- [ ] S — Single Responsibility: Each class/function has one reason to change?
- [ ] O — Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification?
- [ ] L — Liskov Substitution: Subclasses can replace parents without breaking?
- [ ] I — Interface Segregation: No client forced to depend on methods it doesn't use?
- [ ] D — Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations?

**Scoring Guidance:**
- 90-100%: Clear SOLID adherence, good abstractions
- 75-89%: Minor violations (e.g., tight coupling in one module)
- 60-74%: Multiple violations affecting code quality
- <60%: Pervasive SOLID violations, hard to extend

**Example Issues:**

```
Issue: Tight Coupling (PaymentController depends on concrete UserRepository)
Severity: P2 (SOLID violation)
Location: src/controllers/PaymentController.java, line 23
Problem: Constructor: new UserRepository() — hard-coded dependency
Why: Can't swap implementations for testing, violates Dependency Inversion
Fix: Inject UserRepository interface via constructor
```

#### 4.3 Patterns & Best Practices

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Are common patterns used correctly? (Factory, Strategy, Observer, etc.)
- [ ] Are error handling patterns consistent?
- [ ] Are null/empty checks done uniformly?
- [ ] Are async operations handled correctly?
- [ ] Is there code duplication that suggests a missing pattern?

**Scoring Guidance:**
- 90-100%: Good use of patterns, minimal duplication, consistent style
- 75-89%: Some code duplication, minor pattern misuse
- 60-74%: Duplication or anti-patterns in critical paths
- <60%: Pervasive code smells, missed optimization opportunities

**Example Issues:**

```
Issue: Missing Error Pattern (try/except with no handler)
Severity: P1 (Pattern violation)
Location: src/services/payment_service.py, line 42
Problem: try: process_payment() except Exception: pass
Why: Errors silently swallowed; no logging or recovery
Fix: Catch specific exceptions, log, and re-raise or handle gracefully
```

#### 4.4 Performance & Scalability

**Checklist:**
- [ ] No N+1 query patterns (loop with DB call inside)?
- [ ] Pagination used for large datasets?
- [ ] Caching applied to expensive operations?
- [ ] Async/non-blocking for I/O (network, files, DB)?
- [ ] No unnecessary full table scans?
- [ ] No unbounded loops or recursion?
- [ ] Memory usage reasonable (no leaks, unbounded collections)?

**Scoring Guidance:**
- 90-100%: Efficient code, good use of caching, async patterns
- 75-89%: Minor inefficiencies, mostly acceptable performance
- 60-74%: Obvious optimization opportunities (N+1, missing pagination)
- <60%: Code will struggle at scale (full scans, unbounded loops)

**Example Issues:**

```
Issue: N+1 Query Pattern
Severity: P1 (Performance)
Location: src/services/order_service.py, line 67-72
Problem:
  orders = db.query(Order).all()  # Loads all orders
  for order in orders:
    customer = db.query(Customer).filter(...).one()  # N queries!
Why: Will scale poorly; 1000 orders = 1001 queries
Fix: Use JOIN to load customers with orders in single query
  orders = db.query(Order).join(Customer).all()
```

#### 4.5 Security

**Checklist:**
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (passwords, API keys, tokens)?
- [ ] SQL queries parameterized (no string concatenation)?
- [ ] User inputs validated and sanitized?
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checks present?
- [ ] No sensitive data logged (passwords, tokens, PII)?
- [ ] No insecure deserialization?
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (if applicable)?
- [ ] CORS configured appropriately?

**Scoring Guidance:**
- 90-100%: Strong security posture, validated inputs, no secrets
- 75-89%: Minor issues (e.g., one unvalidated field)
- 60-74%: Multiple security gaps (hardcoded secrets, missing validation)
- <60%: Critical vulnerabilities (SQL injection, exposed credentials)

**Example Issues:**

```
Issue: SQL Injection Vulnerability
Severity: P0 (Security)
Location: src/repositories/user_repo.java, line 34
Problem:
  String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '" + email + "'";
  ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery(query);
Why: Email input not escaped; attacker can inject SQL
Risk: Unauthorized data access, data deletion
Fix: Use parameterized query
  String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?";
  PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
  stmt.setString(1, email);
```

#### 4.6 Testing & Test Coverage

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Unit tests for business logic?
- [ ] Happy path tests present?
- [ ] Error cases tested?
- [ ] Edge cases covered?
- [ ] Test code is clean and maintainable?
- [ ] Mock/stub dependencies appropriately?
- [ ] Coverage >= 80% for critical code?

**Scoring Guidance:**
- 90-100%: >90% coverage, good test names, comprehensive scenarios
- 75-89%: 70-90% coverage, mostly good tests, minor gaps
- 60-74%: <70% coverage, gaps in error cases or edge cases
- <60%: Minimal tests, critical scenarios untested

**Example Issues:**

```
Issue: Missing Error Case Test
Severity: P1 (Testing)
Location: tests/test_payment.py (missing)
Problem: No test for payment failure scenario
Why: Code path untested; might fail silently in production
Fix: Add test_payment_failure_with_retry test case
```

#### 4.7 Documentation & Code Comments

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Public functions have docstrings (with parameters, returns)?
- [ ] Complex logic has inline comments?
- [ ] Edge cases documented?
- [ ] API/contract examples provided?
- [ ] README or architecture docs present?

**Scoring Guidance:**
- 90-100%: Comprehensive docstrings, clear examples, architecture documented
- 75-89%: Most functions documented, minor gaps
- 60-74%: Some functions undocumented, complex logic unclear
- <60%: Minimal documentation, hard to understand

**Example Issues:**

```
Issue: Missing Docstring
Severity: P2 (Documentation)
Location: src/services/payment_service.py, line 45
Problem: validate_card() function has no docstring
Why: Unclear what parameters are expected, what exceptions can be raised
Fix: Add docstring:
  """
  Validate credit card details.
  
  Args:
    card_number (str): 16-digit card number
    expiry (str): Expiry date as MM/YY
    cvv (str): 3-digit CVV code
    
  Returns:
    bool: True if valid, raises CardValidationError if invalid
    
  Raises:
    CardValidationError: If card details invalid
  """
```

```

---

## 5. Phase 4: Test Coverage Analysis

### Purpose
Analyze tests to verify that code changes are adequately tested. Check for happy path, error cases, and edge cases.

### Input
- Code diff (added/modified production code)
- Test files (new/modified test code)

### Process Steps

**Step 1: Quantify Code Changes**
```
Production Code:
- Lines added: 150
- Lines modified: 45
- Lines deleted: 20

Test Code:
- Lines added: 120
- Lines modified: 30
- Lines deleted: 5
```

**Step 2: Identify Test Scenarios**
For each new/modified function, check for:

| Scenario | Example | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Happy path | Valid input → correct output | ✅ Should test |
| Error cases | Invalid input → exception | ⚠️ Often missing |
| Boundary cases | Empty, null, negative, max values | ⚠️ Often missing |
| Integration | Multiple functions together | ⚠️ May need integration test |
| Concurrency | Simultaneous requests | ⚠️ For async code |

**Step 3: Coverage Analysis**

```
Function: create_user(email, password)
  Total lines: 25
  
  Happy Path Test: test_create_user_valid_email
    ✅ Covers: valid email input, password hashing, user creation
    Lines tested: 15/25 (60%)
  
  Error Cases:
    ⚠️ MISSING: test_create_user_invalid_email
    ⚠️ MISSING: test_create_user_duplicate_email
    ⚠️ MISSING: test_create_user_db_failure
  
  Estimated Coverage: 60%
```

**Step 4: Calculate Test Coverage Score**

| Coverage % | Meaning | Rating |
|---|---|---|
| 90-100% | Comprehensive: happy + errors + edges | Excellent |
| 75-89% | Good: happy path + some error cases | Good |
| 60-74% | Fair: happy path mostly covered | Fair |
| 40-59% | Weak: very basic testing | Weak |
| <40% | Critical: barely tested | Critical Gap |

### Output Format

```markdown
## Test Coverage Analysis

### Code Coverage Metrics
- Production code added: 215 lines
- Production code modified: 45 lines
- Test code added: 120 lines
- Estimated overall coverage: 75%

### Test Scenario Checklist

#### Function: POST /auth/signup (backend/routes/auth.py)
- [✅] Happy path: Valid email + password → user created
- [✅] Error case: Invalid email → 400 Bad Request
- [⚠️] Error case: Duplicate email → 409 Conflict (not tested)
- [⚠️] Error case: Email service fails → 500 with graceful error
- [✅] Edge case: Very long password (255+ chars)
- [⚠️] Integration: Email sent successfully after signup

#### Function: validateEmail() (backend/validators/email.py)
- [✅] Happy path: valid@example.com → True
- [✅] Error case: invalid-email → False
- [✅] Edge case: email@localhost (no TLD) → False
- [⚠️] Edge case: international domain (IDN) → handling unclear

### Coverage Gaps
1. **Missing Error Case Test**: Duplicate email signup
   - Severity: P1
   - Impact: Concurrent signups might not be handled correctly
   - Fix: Add test_create_user_duplicate_email test

2. **Missing Integration Test**: Email failure recovery
   - Severity: P1
   - Impact: Silent failures if email service is down
   - Fix: Mock email service failure, verify retry logic

3. **Missing Edge Case Test**: Password edge cases
   - Severity: P2
   - Impact: May fail with very long or special characters
   - Fix: Add parameterized test with edge cases

### Test Quality Assessment
- Test naming: ✅ Good (givenX_whenY_thenZ pattern used)
- AAA pattern: ✅ Good (Arrange-Act-Assert clear)
- Mocking: ✅ Good (dependencies properly mocked)
- Assertions: ✅ Clear and specific

### Overall Test Coverage Score: **75%**
= (Lines with test coverage / Total production lines) × 100
```

---

## 6. Phase 5: Documentation Analysis

### Purpose
Verify that code changes are well-documented with docstrings, comments, and examples.

### Input
- Code diff (new/modified functions and classes)

### Process Steps

**Step 1: Check Documentation Completeness**

For each public function/class, verify:

| Item | Example | Required |
|------|---------|----------|
| Function docstring | """Create user and send email""" | ✅ Yes |
| Parameter docs | Args: email (str): User email | ✅ Yes |
| Return docs | Returns: User object | ✅ Yes |
| Exception docs | Raises: ValueError if email invalid | ✅ Yes |
| Usage example | Email will be sent within 2s | ⚠️ For complex APIs |
| Inline comments | # Hash password using bcrypt | ✅ For complex logic |

**Step 2: Assess Documentation Quality**

```
Function: create_user(email: str, password: str) → User

✅ Documented:
  """
  Create a new user account.
  
  Args:
    email (str): User email (RFC 5322 format required)
    password (str): Plain-text password (min 8 chars)
    
  Returns:
    User: Created user object with ID
    
  Raises:
    ValueError: If email invalid or duplicate
    SMTPError: If confirmation email fails
    
  Example:
    user = create_user("alice@example.com", "secure123")
    # User created, confirmation email sent within 2s
  """

❌ Missing:
  - Inline comments explaining password hashing strategy
  - Edge cases documented (what if email service slow?)
```

**Step 3: Calculate Documentation Score**

| Score | Criteria | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 90-100% | All public functions documented, examples provided | Comprehensive docstrings, clear examples |
| 75-89% | Most functions documented, some gaps | Functions documented, few examples |
| 60-74% | Partial documentation, important gaps | Basic docstrings, no complex logic explained |
| <60% | Minimal documentation | Few docstrings, hard to understand |

## 8. Issue Format & Severity Scale

### Issue Structure

Every issue must include these fields:

```json
{
  "category": "Security|Design|SOLID|Patterns|Performance|Testing|Documentation",
  "severity": "P0|P1|P2|P3",
  "blocks_merge": true,
  "file": "src/auth/register.py",
  "line_range": "42-45",
  "title": "SQL injection vulnerability in user lookup",
  "description": "User input not parameterized in SQL query",
  "why_it_matters": "Attacker can inject SQL to read/modify/delete arbitrary data",
  "before_code": "cur.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ' + str(user_id))",
  "after_code": "cur.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', (user_id,))",
  "references": "OWASP Top 10 #1: Injection",
  "effort_to_fix": "15 minutes"
}
```

**New v3.0 fields:**
- `blocks_merge` (boolean) — whether this issue must be fixed before PR can merge (typically true for P0/P1)
- `before_code` (string) — current/broken code that needs fixing
- `after_code` (string) — corrected code (replaces `suggested_fix`)

### Severity Scale

| Level | Code | Meaning | Action | Block Merge? |
|-------|------|---------|--------|--------------|
| Critical | P0 | Causes data loss, outages, security breaches in production | Fix before next deploy | ✅ Yes |
| High | P1 | Causes user-visible failures or significant perf degradation | Fix in current sprint | ✅ Yes |
| Medium | P2 | Causes intermittent issues or technical debt that compounds | Fix in next sprint | ⚠️ Case-by-case |
| Low | P3 | Code smell, maintainability, minor inefficiency | Fix when touching code | ❌ No |

### Triage Rules & Merge Blocking

- **P0** (`blocks_merge: true`): Always block merge. Examples: SQL injection, unhandled exception, data corruption risk
  - Status in report: 🔴 CRITICAL — FIX REQUIRED BEFORE MERGE
- **P1** (`blocks_merge: true` unless explicitly marked as advisory): Usually block merge. Examples: Missing test, missing doc, poor performance, API design issue
  - Status in report: 🟠 HIGH — RECOMMEND FIX BEFORE MERGE
- **P2** (`blocks_merge: false`): Acceptable with acknowledgment. Examples: Code duplication, magic numbers, suboptimal but working
  - Status in report: 🟡 MEDIUM — FIX IN NEXT SPRINT (optional)
- **P3** (`blocks_merge: false`): Informational. Examples: Style issues, minor refactoring suggestions, linting hints
  - Status in report: 🟢 LOW — NICE-TO-HAVE (FIX LATER)

### Context-Aware Review Rules

When context parameters are provided to quality:review:
- `review-scope`: Only deeply review files matching scope; label others "OUT OF SCOPE — not reviewed"
- `success-criteria`: Treat each criterion as an additional AC to validate in PHASE 2
- `business-justification`: Weight security/compliance issues more heavily when compliance is cited (e.g., SOC 2)
- `context`: Surface in every phase output header so the reviewer understands the WHY

## 9. Output Report Structure

### Section 1: Executive Summary

```markdown
## Executive Summary

**PR:** #456 (feature/user-auth → main)  
**JIRA:** PROJ-123 (User Registration with Email Validation)  
**Submitted by:** alice@example.com  
**Review Date:** 2026-05-25 14:30 UTC

### Quick Stats
- Files changed: 8
- Lines added: 350
- Lines removed: 25
- Tests added: 45

### Overall Grade: **B** (86.5/100)

**Status:** ⚠️ Changes Needed — Please address test coverage before merge

**Summary:**
Feature is well-implemented with clean code. Requirement fully met (95%). 
Main gap: test coverage needs improvement (75% → 90%) to cover error cases 
and edge cases. Once tests are added, this will be ready to merge.
```

### Section 2: Requirement Validation

```markdown
## Requirement Validation

### Feature Overview
User Registration with Email Validation

### Plain English
"Allow new users to sign up with email and password. System validates email format, 
hashes passwords securely, and sends a confirmation email."

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage
| AC | Requirement | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AC1 | User can enter email and password | ✅ | Form implemented, backend endpoint ready |
| AC2 | Email validation enforced | ✅ | RFC 5322 validator in place |
| AC3 | Passwords hashed securely | ✅ | bcrypt with salt implemented |
| AC4 | Confirmation email sent | ⚠️ | Email sent, but no retry on failure |
| AC5 | Responsive UI | ✅ | Mobile/desktop tested |

### Requirement Coverage: **95%**

### Gaps Found
1. **AC4 Gap**: Email sending has no retry logic
   - Impact: P1 — If email service temporarily fails, signup appears successful but user never receives confirmation
   - Fix: Add 3-retry logic with exponential backoff
```

### Section 3: Code Quality Issues

```markdown
## Code Quality Issues

### Summary
- **Total Issues:** 4
- **P0 (Critical):** 0
- **P1 (High):** 1
- **P2 (Medium):** 2
- **P3 (Low):** 1

### Issues by Category
- Design: 1 P2
- SOLID: 0
- Patterns: 1 P2
- Performance: 0
- Security: 1 P1
- Testing: 1 P2
- Documentation: 0

### Critical Issues (P0/P1)

#### Issue #1: SQL Injection Risk in Email Lookup
- **Severity:** P1 (High)
- **Category:** Security
- **File:** src/repositories/user_repository.py, line 42
- **Problem:** Email field not parameterized in SQL query
- **Why:** Attacker can inject SQL to access unauthorized data
- **Fix:** Use parameterized query with bound parameters
- **Estimated effort:** 15 minutes

### Medium Issues (P2)

#### Issue #2: Tight Coupling in AuthService
- **Severity:** P2
- **Category:** Design
- **File:** src/services/auth_service.py, line 15
- **Problem:** Hard-coded dependency on EmailService (new EmailService())
- **Why:** Can't mock in tests; violates Dependency Inversion
- **Fix:** Inject EmailService via constructor parameter
- **Estimated effort:** 30 minutes

### Low Issues (P3)

#### Issue #3: Code Duplication in Validators
- **Severity:** P3
- **Category:** Patterns
- **File:** src/validators/email.py and src/validators/password.py
- **Problem:** Both use similar regex validation pattern
- **Why:** Maintenance burden if validation rules change
- **Fix:** Extract shared regex into BaseValidator class
- **Estimated effort:** 45 minutes
```

### Section 4: Test Coverage Analysis

```markdown
## Test Coverage Analysis

### Coverage Metrics
- Production lines added: 215
- Test lines added: 120
- Estimated coverage: 75%

### Missing Test Scenarios

#### Function: create_user()
- [✅] Happy path: Valid email + password
- [⚠️] MISSING: Duplicate email error
- [⚠️] MISSING: Email service failure + retry
- [✅] Edge case: Long password

### Coverage Gaps
| Gap | Severity | Effort |
|-----|----------|--------|
| Duplicate email error test | P1 | 1 hour |
| Email failure + retry test | P1 | 1.5 hours |
| Password edge cases | P2 | 30 min |

### Overall Test Coverage: **75%**
**Recommendation:** Improve to 90%+ before merge
```

### Section 5: Documentation Analysis

```markdown
## Documentation Analysis

### Documentation Quality
- Docstrings: 90% (9/10 functions documented)
- Inline comments: 85% (complex logic explained)
- Usage examples: 40% (should be >70%)
- README/architecture: 0% (not provided)

### Documentation Gaps
1. Missing: How to handle signup errors in frontend
2. Missing: InvalidEmailError exception docs
3. Missing: Email service failure recovery strategy

### Overall Documentation: **80%**
**Recommendation:** Add usage examples before merge
```

### Section 6: Final Recommendations

```markdown
## Recommendations & Action Items

### Before Merge (Blocking)
- [ ] Fix SQL injection vulnerability (P1 Security)
  - Effort: 15 min
  - Impact: HIGH — blocks all signups if exploited
  
- [ ] Add missing error case tests (P1 Testing)
  - Effort: 2 hours
  - Impact: HIGH — untested failure paths
  
- [ ] Add retry logic for email service (P1 Testing)
  - Effort: 1.5 hours
  - Impact: HIGH — silent failures if email service fails

### Nice to Have (Non-Blocking)
- [ ] Refactor AuthService to inject EmailService (P2 Design)
  - Effort: 30 min
  - Impact: MEDIUM — improves testability

- [ ] Extract shared validation logic (P3 Patterns)
  - Effort: 45 min
  - Impact: LOW — reduces duplication

### Suggested Review Process
1. Author fixes P0/P1 issues (2-3 hours)
2. Re-run review to verify
3. Merge once score reaches B+ (85%+)
```

## 10. FAQ

### Q: What if JIRA requirement is vague?
**A:** Translate to best understanding and note the vagueness in the report. Suggest clarification in recommendations section. Score may be lower due to ambiguity.

### Q: What if no tests exist?
**A:** Test coverage scored as critically low (0-20%). Flag as P0 gap. Code cannot be merged without tests.

### Q: Can teams customize scoring weights?
**A:** Yes. Default weights are: Requirement (40%), Code Quality (30%), Testing (20%), Docs (10%). Can be adjusted per team policy. Document in CLAUDE.md.

### Q: What if code is perfect but requirement is unclear?
**A:** Grade will reflect the ambiguity. A "B" with note: "Excellent code quality, but requirement validation unclear. Clarify with product team before merge."

### Q: How do we handle third-party code or generated code?
**A:** Review as normal, but add note: "Third-party dependency. Severity scores may differ." For generated code, focus on integration points and configuration correctness rather than code quality.

### Q: What's the typical review time?
**A:** 15-30 minutes for <500 lines, 30-60 minutes for large PRs. Includes: requirement analysis, code review, test assessment, report generation.

### Q: Should reviews block merge or just be advisory?
**A:** Default: P0 issues block merge, P1 may block depending on team policy, P2/P3 are advisory. Configure in CLAUDE.md.

### Q: How do we handle security reviews?
**A:** All code flagged as P0/P1 security issues block merge unconditionally. Consider a separate "Security Review" phase with expert checklist for sensitive code (auth, payment, data).

## 11. Tech-Agnostic Nature

This skill is **tech-agnostic** because:

1. **All patterns are universal** — SRP, SOLID, N+1 queries exist in every language
2. **Severity scale is language-independent** — P0-P3 applies to Java, Python, React, SQL equally
3. **Process is framework-agnostic** — Works for Spring Boot, FastAPI, React, any stack
4. **Examples use pseudocode** — Concepts shown, not language-specific implementation
5. **Issue categories are universal** — Design, Security, Performance matter everywhere

**Language-specific guidance:** When implementing this skill for a specific language, create a supplementary guide with language-specific examples (e.g., "Java Security Checklist") but keep the core process in this skill.
