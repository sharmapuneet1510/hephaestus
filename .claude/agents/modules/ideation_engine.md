# Ideation Engine Module

## Purpose
Systematically refine vague ideas into detailed project specifications with expert feedback integration. Used by orchestrator:ideate.

## Process Phases

### Phase 1: Clarification (Questions)
Ask 5-7 targeted questions to solidify the concept:
1. **Core Purpose** — "What problem does this solve? Who has it?"
2. **Target Users** — "Who are the primary users? What's their scale?"
3. **Success Definition** — "How do you measure success?"
4. **Constraints** — "What are hard constraints (time, budget, team)?"
5. **Differentiation** — "What makes this different from existing solutions?"
6. **MVP Scope** — "What's the minimum viable product?"
7. **Key Risks** — "What could cause this to fail?"

### Phase 2: Concept Refinement
Synthesize clarification answers into:
- **Refined Concept Statement** (2-3 sentences)
- **Target Users** (personas, scale)
- **Success Criteria** (measurable)
- **Core Assumptions** (what must be true)

### Phase 3: Project Planning
Generate detailed breakdown:
- **Milestones** (phases with duration, deliverables, dependencies)
- **Tasks** (granular work items, 2-week max estimates)
- **Resource Allocation** (skills needed, team composition)
- **RAID Analysis** (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies)
- **Timeline** (start → end, critical path)

## Output Format

  target_users:
    - segment: "SMB founders/operators"
      scale: "100-500 employees"
      pain_point: "Manual reporting taking 20+ hours/month"

  assumptions:
    - "SMB market is underserved"

  assumptions:
    - "Team can ship MVP in 14 weeks"
    - "Integrations API becomes stable (not breaking frequently)"
    - "No major competitors emerge in 6 months"

    - "Decision: Self-hosted or managed infrastructure?"

## Usage Example

**Input to module:**
```
idea: "Build a multi-tenant SaaS analytics platform"
constraints:
  timeline: "6 months"
  budget: "$200k"
  team_size: 4
  tech_stack: "Python/FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL"
mode: "comprehensive"  # or "quick"
```

**Output from module:**
- idea-spec.md (refined concept, assumptions, success criteria)
- project-plan.json (milestones, tasks, resources)
- raid-analysis.md (risks, assumptions, issues, dependencies)
- project-plan.csv (exportable to Jira, Asana, Monday.com)

## Notes
- Questions should be open-ended to encourage discovery
- Concept refinement should incorporate expert feedback (from expert_panel_generator)
- Project tasks should never exceed 2 weeks (break larger items into sub-tasks)
- Timeline should include 10-20% buffer for unknowns
